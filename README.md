# YouTube Feed Cleaner

[![RU](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-RU-blue.svg)](README_ru.md)

An elegant and lightweight Google Chrome extension designed to fine-tune and clean up your YouTube feed. It allows you to focus on engaging content by automatically hiding intrusive elements and already watched videos.

## Features

The extension provides a user-friendly interface (styled in a dark Obsidian theme with red accents) to manage the following features:

* **Hide Mixes:** Removes auto-generated endless playlists from the general feed and recommendations.
* **Block Shorts:** Allows you to separately disable the display of short videos on the Home page and in Search results.
* **Filter Watched Videos:** Automatically hides video cards on the Home page if their viewing progress is 70% or more.
* **Filter by Publication Date:** Allows you to hide videos from the Home page that are older than a specified period (from 1 week to 1 year).
* **Multilingual Support:** The extension interface automatically adapts to your browser's language (built-in support for English and Russian).

Currently, the extension is installed in developer mode directly from the source code.
